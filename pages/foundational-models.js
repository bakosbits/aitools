                    Foundational Models: Understanding the Core of Modern AI
                </h1>
                <p className="mb-4 ml-2">
                    The rise of AI tools and applications today can be traced
                    back to a handful of foundational models that serve as the
                    bedrock for everything from chatbots and image generation to
                    data analysis and code completion. These models aren’t just
                    powerful, they’re general-purpose systems that other tools
                    are built on top of. Below, we break down six of the most
                    important foundational models, explaining what each one does
                    and why it matters.

                    GPT is arguably the most widely recognized foundational
                    model. Trained on a massive corpus of text, it predicts the
                    next word in a sequence, allowing it to generate human-like
                    responses. GPT models power a huge range of applications:
                    customer support bots, writing assistants, coding copilots,
                    and more. What makes GPT foundational is its adaptability.
                    It can be fine-tuned or prompted to take on many different
                    tasks without task-specific training.

                    Claude is similar to GPT but places greater emphasis on
                    constitutional AI, a method that encodes values and ethical
                    boundaries into the model via principles rather than
                    hard-coded rules. This makes Claude appealing in settings
                    where safety, moderation, and interpretability are
                    priorities. Claude has become a strong alternative to GPT in
                    tools that emphasize ethical or instructable behavior.
